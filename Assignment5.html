        Google Fonts is a library of free licensed font families, an interactive
        web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using
        the fonts via CSS and Android. The directory was launched in 2010 and
        revised in 2011 and 2016. Most fonts are released under the SIL Open
        Font License 1.1, while some are released under the Apache License ; in
        both cases it is a so-called libre license, i.e. free software. The font
        library is also distributed by Monotype SkyFonts and Adobe Edge Web
        Fonts and Typekit. The purpose of the Google Fonts directory is to allow
        you to search and explore fonts. The service is heavily used: users have
        downloaded more than 17 trillion fonts during its lifetime, which means
        that on average each of the 960 font sets has been downloaded more than
        19 billion times, and that every person on Earth has downloaded each
        font at least two or three times on average. Popular fonts include Open
        Sans , Roboto , Lato , Slabo , Oswald , and Lobster. The library is maintained through the Google Fonts GitHub repository at github .com /google /fonts , where all font files can be obtained directly. Source files for many fonts are available in git repositories within the GitHub organization, along with free tools used by the Google Fonts community.
